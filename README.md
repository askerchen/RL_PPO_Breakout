# RL_PPO_Breakout
Use stable-baseline3 to train a PPO model in Atari Breakout environment

+ You can use tensorboard to see the training process.

`tensorboard logdir=tensorboard\breakout`

+ You can also use stable-baseline3 to load the trained model.

  Because the limit of computing ability, the performance of the model isn't good.
